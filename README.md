![Image](assets/images/readme-files/responsive.jpg)

## Welcome to Zuzu Valla Wedding Photography website.

#### To see the live website, please click on this [link](https://ondrejvalla.github.io/zuzu-valla/).

I would like to share with you this website, which I created as my First Milestone Project with Code Institute.
I created this website for my wife Zuzana Valla, who loves the photography. I think she is very talented. 
Zuzana's main focus is portrait photography, however, many people keep asking her if she could be their wedding photographer.<br> 
Zuzana's current website only displays her art photography, therefore people can not see any wedding portraits.<br>
The aim of this project was to create a user-friendly website that could give my wife the ability to present herself as a wedding photographer.<br>
I focused to design easy to navigate website, where all potential customers can find out more about Zuzu, see her previous work and be able to get in touch.  
I hope you will enjoy this website.

## Overview 

We all know that couples planning their big wedding day have lots of preparation to do.
There is a lot of wedding photographers out there which they can choose from and lots of website to click through.
That is why I believe they like to see easy to orientate website, with useful information about the photographer 
and of course to see a portfolio of photographs and prices. And lastly, the ability to effectively contact the photographer to discuss any queries they may have.

### User Stories

- User story 1: We would like to be able to easily navigate through Zuzu's website on the laptop and on our mobile phones.
- User story 2: As we are considering Zuzu to be our wedding photographer we would like to see her portfolio of previous weddings.
- User story 3: As we are currently in the stage of creating our wedding budget, 
                we would like to know how much does Zuzu Valla charge and what are we going to get for our money.
- User story 4: We would like to contact Zuzu through this website.
- User story 5: We would like to see Zuzu's social media profiles.
- User story 6: My friend has sent me the link to this website. I am asking myself "Who is Zuzu Valla?"

### The Scope Plane

In order to be able to decide who is going to be a couple's wedding photographer,
users must be able to find out the portfolio of previous work to see the photography style,
different packaging options, what does each package include and how much each package costs and 
who is the photographer capturing all them moments of their wedding day.

### The Structure Plane

This website consists of eight pages separated into four main sections:
- Home page contains a carousel slideshow, creating a"Love is in the air" atmosphere. 
  Navbars in the Header and in the Footer to be able to continue further in to website. 
- Gallery page has two sections of: 
  1. Four wedding galleries links which takes users to individual wedding gallery page.
  2. The package/price list section on the bottom of the page.
- About page with profile picture and personal profile text.
- Contact page with the photo of Zuzu Valla, Contact form and Package selection form, submit and reset buttons.

Each page has the navbar in the header and navbar in the footer for easy navigation through the website.<br>

### Wireframes 

As this was my first time creating wireframes I was not definitely decided about each detail of this website. 
However, I believe the main structure of the page has remained.
I did implement a carousel on the home page. 
I also found carousels very useful in each one of four individual gallery pages.
I have also added a price list at the bottom of the gallery page.

- Landing Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/landing-page.pdf" target="_blank">Home</a>

- Gallery Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/gallery-page.pdf" target="_blank">Gallery</a>

- About Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/about-page.pdf" target="_blank">About</a>

- Contact Page: <a href="assets/wireframes/contact-page.pdf" target="_blank">Contact</a>

### The Surface Plane

I was aiming to achieve a wedding mood touch of this website and also
to make it more personal by using my wife's favourite colours which are pink and red.  

- #### Images 
    All images used on this website were taken by my wife Zuzan Valla or myself Ondrej Valla.<br>
    Zuzana did the selection of photographs for me to use.

- #### Colours
    - I was aiming to use a colour theme to match the wedding atmosphere.<br>
    - The main and most dominant colour is colour of Header and Footer which is a darker shade of red, rgb(143,67,80)
    - The secondary dominant colour is a slightly pink colour which is used on most of the page's background, rgb(177, 107, 117)
    - The third most used colour is Gray98 color, #fafafafa
    - And lastly, my favourite is the beautiful red colour of the rose image which is used as a background on each individual wedding gallery page.

- #### Icons
    - I used site Font Awesome to create Logo icons in Header and Footer.

## Bugs

- At the beginning of this project I was not using a bootstrap grid (with container > row > column). This caused a horizontal overflow and an un-organized appearance.
  Once started to use the bootstrap grid (container-fluid) class, the issues were improved.

- The first time generating of the project Bootstrap link I found out that lots of images were not displaying. 
  This was simple, but a very helpful learning curve. My file paths were incorrect. /assets/images...jpg instead of no slash assets/images...jpg 

- The original front-page hero image was unresponsive on small screens and mobile devices. 
  After several unsuccessful attempts of wrapping the image into Bootstrap grid, I found out that the actual image size is too wide and low,
  unable to fit the mobile screen size. 
  I completely removed this particular Hero image and applied a Carousel. 
  This Carousel has improved the responsiveness of the front page and also improved the appearance of the page.

- My first menu page was not collapsing into the burger menu. All that was happening was only the resizing of the menu.
  This was not up to visual and technical standard expectation, that is why I have decided to use Bootstrap Navbar.
  The responsiveness has improved massively and on the medium and small screens, the Burger menu appears.   

- The current Burger menu was not appearing on the right. I was always in the middle. 
  I created a new class for the element and by using position relative I was able to direct the menu where I wanted it.
