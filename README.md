## Welcome to "Zuzu Valla Wedding Photography" website.

#### To see the live website, please click on this [link](https://ondrejvalla.github.io/zuzu-valla/).

I would like to share with you this website, which I created as my First Milestone Project with Code Institute.
I created this website for my wife Zuzana Valla, who loves her photography. I think she is very talented. 
Zuzana's main focus is portrait photography, however, many people keep asking her if she could be their wedding photographer.<br> 
Zuzana's current website only displays her art photography, therefore people can not see any wedding portraits.<br>
The aim of this project was to create a user-friendly website that could give my wife the ability to present herself as a wedding photographer.<br>
Easy to orientate website, where all potential customers can find out more about Zuzu's history and see a preview of previous weddings portraits. 
Also to clearly display different wedding packages and prices Zuzana has to offer and to be able to contact her directly by the contact form. 
I hope you will enjoy this website.

## Overview  <hr>

We all know that excited couple planning their big wedding day have lots of preparation to do.
There is a lot of wedding photographers out there which they can choose from and lots of website to click through.
That is why I believe they like to see easy to orientate website, with useful information about the photographer 
and of course to see actual photographs and prices. And lastly, the ability to effectively contact the photographer to discuss any queries they may have.
